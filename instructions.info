PART II:

    Download the github repository https://github.com/iotkidd/313ClassKidd.git
    Obtain the x86 assembly code (.s) for addmats.cpp, addmatsSimple.c, and addmatsSubr.c
    Write up your general observations on how the assembly looks the same and different for each of the programs. Your observations don't need to be deep or specific, only general. Note that "It's more complicated" isn't going to cut it.


ASSESSMENT: The x86 assembly code is successfully generated and relevant observations made.


NOTE: The assessment is evaluated on the quality of the result. Just because you satisfied the basic requirements does not guarantee it is of high quality.
